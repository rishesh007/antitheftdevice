# AntiTheftDevice
In today's world where cases of theft of valuables are increasing significantly, we felt the need for a smart wearable device to prevent and catch theft. To create a basic prototype of this device, we shall link the smart device to a handheld by means of a wireless connection. Through this link of the device and an Android phone, the user will be able to lock the device from anywhere remotely.

Moreover, when in-sync the device can also send distress/panic signal to the Android using the SOS feature. Our approach towards making it will be to start with a basic Bluetooth and Arduino link for a low range.

An alarm will be triggered immediately after the link is broken hence making it an anti-theft device. As an advancement to the basic model, we will add the location features with an add-on GPS module and a GSM-based connection for a much longer range.

More such devices will then be linked to create an IoT cluster.
